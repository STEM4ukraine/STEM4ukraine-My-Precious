Build this fun project to reflect on the essence of russian spirituality and soulfulness, as discussed by Dostoevsky.

A simple and fun school STEM project demonstrating simple through hole soldering and analogue electronics using USB to power the circuit.

The circuit is very simple, using a pair of resistors and USB power to drive the Gollum's eyes.
